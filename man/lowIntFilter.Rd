\title{Function  lowIntFilter}
\usage{
lowIntFilter(
  x,
  zfpkmThreshold,
  fpkThreshold,
  countThreshold,
  tpmThreshold,
  sampleFraction = 0.5,
  genelength = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A DGEobj with RNA-Seq (counts) data
(required).}

\item{zfpkmThreshold}{Genes below this threshold are removed (-3.0 is recommended)}

\item{fpkThreshold}{Genes below this threshold are removed (recommend 5).}

\item{countThreshold}{Genes below this threshold are removed (recommend 10).
Set to 0 to disable this filter.}

\item{tpmThreshold}{Genes below this threshold are removed (tpm is supported
by request, but FPK is a better length-normalized value to use as a filter)}

\item{sampleFraction}{The proportion of samples that must meet the thresholds
(Default = 0.5). Range >0 and <=1.}

\item{genelength}{Vector of genelengths for rows of x. Required for FPK and
zFPKM filters, unless x is a DGEobj.  If a DGEobj is supplied, genelength is
retrieved from the DGEobj, unless supplied by the genelength argument.}

\item{verbose}{Prints some messages about the filtering process.}
}
\value{
Same class as input object with low intensity rows removed
}
\description{
Takes a DGEobj as input and applies a combination of low
intensity filters. raw count, zFPKM, TPM and/or FPK filters are supported.  A gene
must pass all active filters.  Not setting a threshold argument inactivates that threshold.
}
\examples{

  #simple count threshold
  myDgeObj  = lowIntFilter (myDgeObj, countThreshold=10)

  #count and zFPKM thresholds
  myDgeObj  = lowIntFilter (myDgeObj, countThreshold=10, zfpkmThreshold = -3.0)
