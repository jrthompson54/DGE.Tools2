\title{Function  runIHW}
\usage{
runIHW(contrastList, alpha = 0.1, FDRthreshold = 0.1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{contrastList}{A list of topTable dataframes.}

\item{alpha}{The alpha value is the FDR level you wish to interogate (range 0-1; default = 0.1)}

\item{...}{other arguments are passed directly to the ihw function (see ?ihw).}
}
\value{
A list of lists.  The first element is the original contrastList with
  additional IHW columns added to each dataframe.   The TopTable dataframes
  will contain additional columns added by the ihw analysis and prefixed with
  "ihw." The second list element is the IHW result dataframe.
}
\description{
This is a wrapper around the independent hypothesis weighting package that
takes a list of topTable dataframes and applies Independent Hypothesis
Weighting (IHW) to each topTable dataframe in the list.
}
\details{
IHW is a method developed by N. Ignatiadis (http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/034330)
to weight FDR values based on a covariate (AveExpr in this case).

The IHW FDR values are added as additional columns to the topTable dataframes.

Note that it is impractical to run IHW on a list of genes less than ~5000
because operationally, it breaks the data into bins of 1500 genes for the
analysis if bins = 1, IHW converges on the BH FDR value and there's no point.
So we run IHW on the complete set of detected genes from topTable results
(not topTreat).

\examples{
IHWresults <- runIHW(MyContrastList)
MyContrastList <- IHWresults[[1]]
IHWdf <- IHWresults[[2]]
